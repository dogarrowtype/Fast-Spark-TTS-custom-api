### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Inference Engine Installation

*Install one of the following as needed. If you use Torch for inference, you can skip these additional setups.*

- **vLLM**  
  (Ensure the vLLM version is greater than `0.7.2`.)
  ```bash
  pip install vllm
  ```  
  For details, refer to: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm

- **llama-cpp**
  ```bash
  pip install llama-cpp-python
  ```  
  You can download the pre-converted gguf weights from the [Download Weights](#download-weights) section. Place the
  Spark-TTS weights in the subdirectory `LLM` and the Orpheus-TTS weights in the model directory. If you want to convert
  them yourself, use the `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` script as follows:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git
  
  cd llama.cpp
  
  python convert_hf_to_gguf.py Spark-TTS-0.5B/LLM --outfile Spark-TTS-0.5B/LLM/model.gguf
  ```

- **sglang**
  ```bash
  pip install sglang
  ```  
  For more details, refer to: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang

- **mlx-lm**  
  For running large language models on Apple Silicon (suitable for macOS):
  ```bash
  pip install mlx-lm
  ```  
  For more details, refer to: https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm

### Starting the Service

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HuiResearch/Fast-Spark-TTS.git
   cd Fast-Spark-TTS
   ```

2. **Start the SparkTTS API Service**

   The `backend` option can be selected based on your environment. Currently supported backends include `torch`, `vllm`,
   `sglang`, `llama-cpp`, and `mlx-lm`.

   ```bash
   python server.py \
   --model_path Spark-TTS-0.5B \  # Modify this to your model directory as needed
   --backend vllm \  # Choose one: vllm, sglang, torch, llama-cpp, or mlx-lm
   --llm_device cuda \
   --tokenizer_device cuda \
   --detokenizer_device cuda \
   --wav2vec_attn_implementation sdpa \
   --llm_attn_implementation sdpa \  # Recommended for torch engine acceleration
   --torch_dtype "bfloat16" \   # For devices that do not support bfloat16, set as float32. Note: this model has issues with float16.
   --max_length 32768 \
   --llm_gpu_memory_utilization 0.6 \
   --host 0.0.0.0 \
   --port 8000
   ```

3. **Start the Flask Web Interface**

   *Flask Frontend Start Command:*
   ```bash
   python frontend.py \
   --backend_url http://127.0.0.1:8000 \  # Customize the backend URL as needed
   --host 0.0.0.0 \ 
   --port 8001
   ```

   In your browser, navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8001
   ```
